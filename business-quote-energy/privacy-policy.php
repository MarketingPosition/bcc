                <div>EnergySavingCompare.co.uk requires the use of your personal contact data only, to help provide you, the prospect, the best products and services for your business needs, through comparing multiple service providers.
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To do this we collect your personal contact data from the completed web forms, supplied on our website or via Facebook, and connect you with the relevant service provider who may call or contact you via the contact data you provide to discuss your requested quotation.</span></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Consent</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – the individual has given clear consent for you to process their personal data for a specific purpose</span></li>
                        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Contract</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – the processing is necessary for a contract you have with the individual, or because they have asked you to take specific steps before entering into a contract</span></li>
                        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Legal Obligation</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – the processing is necessary for you to comply with the law (not including contractual obligations)</span></li>

                        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Public Task</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – the processing is necessary for you to perform a task in the public interest or for your official functions, and the task or function has a clear basis in law</span></li>
                        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Legitimate Interests</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – the processing is necessary for your legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of a third party unless there is a good reason to protect the individual’s personal data which overrides those legitimate interests.

<h3 class="mt-4">INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS</h3>
We share your personal data within our group of companies which involves transferring your data outside the European Economic Area (EEA).

We are subject to the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulations that protect your personal data. Where we transfer your data to third parties outside of the EEA, we will ensure that certain safeguards are in place to ensure a similar degree of security for your personal data. As such:
<ul>
 	<li>We may transfer your personal data to countries that the European Commission have approved as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data by; or</li>

</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>Where we use certain service providers who are established outside of the EEA, we may use specific contracts or codes of conduct or certification mechanisms approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.</li>
</ul>
If none of the above safeguards is available, we may request your explicit consent to the specific transfer. You will have the right to withdraw this consent at any time.
<h3 class="mt-4">DATA SECURITY</h3>
We have put in place security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used, altered, disclosed, or accessed without authorisation. We also allow access to your personal data only to those employees and partners who have a business need to know such data.

<h3 class="mt-4">DATA RETENTION</h3>
We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.

When deciding what the correct time is to keep the data for we look at its amount, nature and sensitivity, potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure, the processing purposes, if these can be achieved by other means and legal requirements.

For tax purposes the law requires us to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for six years after they stop being customers.
